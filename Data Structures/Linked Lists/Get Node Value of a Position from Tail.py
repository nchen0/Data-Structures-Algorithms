# Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and a specific position. Counting backwards from the tail node of the linked list, get the value of the node at the given position. A position of 0 corresponds to the tail, 1 corresponds to the node before the tail and so on.

def getNode(head, positionFromTail):
    current = head
    count = 0
    while current:
        count += 1

    length = 0
    current = head
    while current.next:
        current = current.next
        length += 1
    # get the position from the head:
    positionFromHead = length - positionFromTail

        # Since we're at the tail already anyway
        return current.data
    else:
        # go through loop again:
        current = head
        while current:
            if positionFromHead > 0:
