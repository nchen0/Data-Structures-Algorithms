# Merging Two Packages

"""
Given a package with a weight limit limit and a list weights of item weights, implement a function get_indices_of_item_weights that finds two items whose sum of weights equals the weight limit limit. Your function should return a tuple (i, j) of the indices of the item weights, ordered such that i > j. If such a pair doesnâ€™t exist, return an empty tuple.

Your solution should run in linear time.

Example:

input: arr = [4, 6, 10, 15, 16], limit = 21
output: (3, 1)   # since these are the indices of weights 6 and 15 whose sum equals 21
Hints
A brute-force solution would involve two nested loops, yielding a quadratic-runtime solution. Can we use a hash table in order to implement a solution with a better runtime?
Think about what we can store in the hash table in order to help us to solve this problem more efficiently.
What if we store each weight in the input list as keys? What would be a useful thing to store as the value for each key?
If we store each weight's list index as its value, we can then check to see if the hash table contains an entry for limit - weight. If it does, then we've found the two items whose weights sum up to the limit!

# Self Solution:


def get_indices_of_item_weights(weights, limit):
    # Init the hash table
    dictOfWeights = {}
    for weight in weights:
        # This is O(n) as each item needs to be iterated through.
        dictOfWeights[weight] = weights.index(weight)

    if len(weights) == 1:
        return ()
    elif len(weights) == 2:
        return (1, 0)
    for key, value in dictOfWeights.items():  # O(n)
        new_limit = limit - key
        # This relies on a hash instead of iterating through, so O(1)
        if new_limit in dictOfWeights:
            return (dictOfWeights[new_limit], value)

# ==> O(2n) = O(n)

# Official solution:


def get_indices_of_item_weights(weights, limit):
    weights_dict = {}
    for i in range(len(weights)):
        weight = weights[i]
        if (limit - weight) in weights_dict:
            return (i, weights_dict[limit - weight])
        else:
            weights_dict[weight] = i
    return ()
